# Berryman's self-consistent approximations for N-phase composites are described by the equations: 
# 
#.. math::
#       \sum_{\mathrm{i}=1}^N x_{\mathrm{i}}\left(K_{\mathrm{i}}-K_{\mathrm{SC}}^{e f f}\right) P^{e f f \mathrm{i}}=0 
#
#.. math::
#        \sum_{\mathrm{i}=1}^N x_{\mathrm{i}}\left(\mu_{\mathrm{i}}-\mu_{\mathrm{SC}}^{e f f}\right) Q^{e f f \mathrm{i}}=0
# 
#

# The question is as follows: Calculate the self-consistent effective bulk and shear moduli, :math:`K_{eff}^{SC}`and :math:`G_{eff}^{SC}`, for a water-saturated rock consisting of spherical quartz grains (aspect ratio :math:`\alpha` = 1) and total porosity 0.3. The pore space consists of spherical pores :math:`\alpha` = 1 and thin penny-shaped cracks (:math:`\alpha` = 1e^âˆ’2). The thin cracks have a porosity of 0.01, whereas the remaining porosity (0.29) is made up of the spherical pores.
# 
#
# There are three phases in the composite, i.e. quartz grain, water filled spherical pore, and water filled thin cracks. We can use the method ``EM.Berryman_sc`` to easily solve this exercise to find the effective moduli of the composite.
