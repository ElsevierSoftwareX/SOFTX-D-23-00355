The rock physics diagnostic elastic bounds can be used to infer the microstructure from velocity-porosity data (Avseth et al. 2010). By locally validating the constant cement model and other diagnostic models such as friable sand model and contact cement model, we can obtain a quantitative measure of the degree of cement volume from the resulting diagnostic crossplots.
``QI`` module provides convinient method to perform the cement estimation given data.The following code snippets show the cement volume estimation for synthetic sandstone data. 

Notice that, this method is not strictly valid for cement volume estimation for heavily cemeneted sandstone. The constant cement model has its valid range just like any other models. awareness of the model limitation is necessary when applying the approach in pratice.

Applied to field data 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Let's import the same synthetic well log data and apply the cement volum estimation using constant cement model  to the well log data
