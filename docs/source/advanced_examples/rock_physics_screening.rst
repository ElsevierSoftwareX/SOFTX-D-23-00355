Given tons of petrophysical properties meaured or derived e.g. from well logs, data screening is inevitably required for later intepretation and scenerial modelling. The purpose of data screening is to identify and address any errors, inconsistencies, or missing data in the dataset before any analysis is conducted. 

Avseth et al. (2020) proposed a rock physics model-based data screening approach. Several contact based elastic models are used to generate elastic bounds for high-porosity sands and sandstones (typical reservoir sandstone). These elastic bounds can tell if data comply with physics. Rock physics diagnostic models used are ``friable sand model``,``contact cement model`` and ``increasing cement model``, ``rockphypy`` provides all the implementations. In addition, ``rockphypy`` has written the code used to plot the elastic bounds as a function ``QI.screening``, ``QI`` stands for Quantitative Intepretation. There are many practically useful functionalities in this submodule.

Applied to field data 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Let's import some synthetic well log data and apply the rock physics screening to the well log data
