Errata for the **3rd edition (2020)** of the Rock Physics Handbook
------------------------------------------------------------------

* Page 359: soft-sand model. 
The variable adhesion version of :math:`\mu_{\mathrm{HM}}` should have :math:`\phi` replaced with :math:`\phi_0` to be consistent with the “critical porosity” discussion prior.

Equation 5.5.138 should read: 

.. math:: 
    \mu_{\mathrm{HM}}=\frac{2+3 f-v(1+3 f)}{5(2-v)}\left[\frac{3 C^2(1-\phi_0)^2 \mu}{2 \pi^2(1-v)^2} P\right]^{1 / 3}

* Page 369: 

A typo in equation 6.1.13, should be :math:`\rho_{fl}`, not :math:`\rho_{fi}`.

Equation 6.1.15 should read: 

.. math:: 
    \frac{1}{V_{\mathrm{P}}^2}=\frac{-\left(H q+M \rho-2 C \rho_{\mathrm{fl}}\right) \pm \sqrt{\left(H q+M \rho-2 C \rho_{\mathrm{fl}}\right)^2-4\left(C^2-M H\right)\left(\rho^2_{\mathrm{fl}}-\rho q\right)}}{2\left(C^2-M H\right)}

Equation 6.1.16 should read: 

.. math:: 
    \frac{1}{V_{\mathrm{S}}^2}=\frac{q \rho-\rho^2_{\mathrm{fl}}}{q \mu_{\mathrm{fr}}}

Fluid density should be squared.

* Page 388

Equation 6.6.6 should read: 

.. math:: 
    s_{i j k l}^{\mathrm{sat}}=s_{i j k l}^{\mathrm{dry}}-\frac{\left(s_{i j a a}^{\mathrm{dry}}-s_{i j a a}^0\right)\left(s_{b b k l}^{\mathrm{dry}}-s_{b b k l}^0\right)}{\left(s_{c c d d}^{\mathrm{dry}}-s_{c c d d}^0\right)+\phi\left(\beta_{\mathrm{fl}}-\beta_0\right)}

i.e. there should be a minus sign :math:`s_{i j k l}^{\mathrm{sat}}=s_{i j k l}^{\mathrm{dry}}-(...)`

Eq. 6.6.7 is correct::math:`s_{i j k l}^{\mathrm{sat}}=s_{i j k l}^{\mathrm{dry}} + (...)`

In the text below equation 6.6.6, there is a typo: :math:`\beta_{fl}` is the fluid compressibility. And comma is missing before :math:`\beta_{fl}`

* Page 458

Equation 6.22.8 should read:

.. math:: 
    \log _{10}\left(R_{\mathrm{G}}\right)=\log _{10}\left(0.712 P|T-76.71|^{1.5}+3676 P^{0.64} )-4-7.786 S(T+17.78)^{-0.306}\right.

Right closing parentheses missing after :math:`P^{0.64}`.

* Page 465: The coefficient  should be instead of 0.133. The same applies to the numerical example (page 468). 

.. math:: 
    \epsilon = 0.113



Errata for the **1st Edition (1998)** of the Rock Physics Handbook
------------------------------------------------------------------

*	Page 219: Physical Properties of Gases and Fluids
The equation for Bo should have ...+T+17.8 within the brackets and not ...+T+1.78. This correction also applies to the worked example on page 219.

*	Pages 244-249: Empirical Relations
The section headings for "Greenberg-Castagna" (page 246), "Williams" (page 248), and "Xu and White" (page 249) should be two levels higher. They are not meant to be sub-sections within "Krief's Relation" but are separate sections by themselves.

*	Page 71: Viscoelasticity and Q
The third displayed equation for 1/Q from the bottom of the page should be an approximate equality and not an exact equality.

*	Page 155: Cemented Sand Model 
Equation for C_tau, shoud have +10^(-4) as in Geophysics paper Dvorkin & Nur 1996, not -10^(-4).

*	Reference to J.G. 
Berryman, 1995 "A Handbook of Physical Constants", AGU - the citation should read "Rock Physics & Phase Relations: A Handbook of Physical Constants".

*	Section 7.1, top of page 222
It says: "In the suspension domain, POR > POR_crit, the effective bulk and shear moduli can be estimated quite accurately using by the Reuss (iso-stress) average". Either the word "using" or the word "by" in this sentence needs to be removed.

*	Section 7.8, page 245 
It says that Beta = POR/POR_crit for 0<=POR<=POR_crit and that Beta = 1 for POR < POR_crit. The last inequality is incorrect. It should be "... for POR > POR_crit".

*	Equation S=(3/2)(1-Phi)/d in the middle of page 261 should be S=6(1-Phi)/d

*	Page 157
Typo in the denominator of the Geff calculation. (3/6)*(9*2+8*6)/(2+2*3) = 2.625. Then Geff = 3.97

*	Page 217
Equation at the very bottom: 1/b = 0.306 - 7.6/M is right. The one in RPH and Batzle-Wang equation (16) giving b = 0.306 - 7.6/M is a typo.

*	NOT A TYPO! 
Page 215, third line from the bottom: 1820S^2 should NOT be 820S^2 RPH is correct (1820 S^2). 820 S^2 in Batzle & Wang Geophysics paper is typo.

*	Page 70 
Eqn.2 last term should be 2*mu*epsilon_ij.

*	Page 144
The formula for f should be f = rho * (Vp^2 – 2*Vs^2)
